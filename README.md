# 🌍 Unlocking the Secrets of Life Expectancy with Data & Power BI  

## 📖 The Story Behind This Project  

Have you ever wondered **why people in some countries live longer than others?** 🤔  
Is it all about money? Healthcare? Lifestyle? Or something else?  

These questions sparked my curiosity, so I decided to explore **real-world life expectancy data** using **Power BI**. The goal?  
To uncover patterns and insights that can help policymakers, businesses, and organizations make **data-driven decisions** to improve public health.  

## 📊 Project Overview  

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** analyzing life expectancy trends across different countries.  
It covers:  
✅ The relationship between **GDP and life expectancy**  
✅ How **infant mortality** impacts overall longevity  
✅ The role of **healthcare spending** in increasing life expectancy  
✅ The impact of **diseases and lifestyle factors**  

## 🚀 Skills & Tools Used  

- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  
- **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values and preparing data  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For custom calculations  
- **Data Visualization** – Creating meaningful charts and reports  
- **Business Intelligence** – Extracting insights for decision-making  

## 📌 Key Insights & Takeaways  

🔹 **Money Helps, But Policies Matter More**  
   - Richer countries generally have higher life expectancy, but **some low-GDP nations achieve better health outcomes** through smart policies.  

🔹 **Infant Mortality is a Game Changer**  
   - Countries with high infant mortality rates see **drastically lower average life expectancy**.  
   - **Preventive healthcare & vaccinations** can make a huge difference.  

🔹 **Healthcare Spending ≠ Better Health**  
   - Just spending more on healthcare doesn’t always lead to better outcomes.  
   - **Access to quality care, education, and nutrition** play a bigger role.
